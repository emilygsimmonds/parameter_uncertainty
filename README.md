# parameter_uncertainty

This repository is for the running of T1.2 as part of WP1 for my International Mobility Grant: PREDICT. 

## Aim of T1.2

Simulation study to look at impact of parameter uncertainty on the conclusions of matrix population models. 

This study looks at two scenarios:

1) This is covered in the code for T1.1 in repository (data_uncertainty)[https://github.com/emilygsimmonds/data_uncertainty/]

2) How are conclusions of real studies impacted by propagating parameter uncertainty into final conclusions? Either as a simulation or using existing published results. 

## Workflow for repository



## Contents of repository

### Functions

### Scripts

- (Doi_to_pdf)[https://github.com/emilygsimmonds/data_uncertainty/blob/main/Scripts/Doi_to_pdf.R]: Script to transform csv of DOIs into Urls and open them automatically
- (Pull_comadre)[https://github.com/emilygsimmonds/data_uncertainty/blob/main/Scripts/Pull_comadre.R]: Script to pull matrices from COMADRE/COMPADRE databases

### Data files

- (DOIS.csv)[]. List of DOIs and Urls for papers selected for T1.2, these are populations published since 2010
- (Flagged_DOIs.csv)[]. DOIs flagged as being studied in Kendall et al and in our list of DOIs.

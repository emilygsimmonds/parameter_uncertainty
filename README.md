# parameter_uncertainty

This repository is for the running of T1.2 as part of WP1 for my International Mobility Grant: PREDICT. 

The work for this part of the grant has now produced an output "Uncertainty propagation in matrix population models: gaps, importance, and guidelines" which can be found archived at X while it undergoes peer review.

## Aim of T1.2

Simulation study to look at impact of parameter uncertainty on the conclusions of matrix population models. 

This study has two key questions:

1) What is the current state of uncertainty reporting and propagation in papers that use MPMs?

2) How could conclusions of real studies be impacted by propagating parameter uncertainty into final conclusions?

These are addressed using a review of literature and a simulation study, respectively.

## Navigating the repository

### Contents of repository

*Please note all code in this repository is written with relative filepaths from the main folder.*

*Meta data and data descriptions are in the Data files folder.*

The main folder of the repository has a few overarching files. 

- **Code description**. Is a pdf that contains schematics detailing which scripts and functions are required to perform different actions. It demonstrates how the code and data files in this repository are connected. We recommed reading this prior to attempting to use the code.
- **parameter_uncertainty.Rproj**. Is the project file for the analysis.

The repository contains the following folders:

 - **Functions**. Which contains all functions used in the analysis of the review results and the simulation study.
 - **Scripts**. Which contains all scripts needed to produce data and results for this study.
 - **Data files**. Which contains all data files used in the study. Project meta data and individual data descriptions can also be found here.
 - **Figures**. Contains figure outputs.
